A single Python program to implement the search-extract-summarize flow, similar to AI search
engines such as Perplexity.

> [!NOTE]
> Our main goal is to illustrate the basic concepts of AI search engines with the raw constructs.
> Performance or scalability is not in the scope of this program.

> [UPDATE]
>
> - 2024-10-28: add extract function as a new output mode
> - 2024-10-25: add hybrid search demo using DuckDB full-text search
> - 2024-10-22: add GradIO integation
> - 2024-10-21: use DuckDB for the vector search and use API for embedding
> - 2024-10-20: allow to specify a list of input urls
> - 2024-10-18: output-language and output-length parameters for LLM
> - 2024-10-18: date-restrict and target-site parameters for seach

## The search-extract-summarize flow

Given a query, the program will

- search Google for the top 10 web pages
- crawl and scape the pages for their text content
- chunk the text content into chunks and save them into a vectordb
- perform a vector search with the query and find the top 10 matched chunks
- [Optional] search using full-text search and combine the results with the vector search
- [Optional] use a reranker to re-rank the top chunks
- use the top chunks as the context to ask an LLM to generate the answer
- output the answer with the references

Of course this flow is a very simplified version of the real AI search engines, but it is a good
starting point to understand the basic concepts.

One benefit is that we can manipulate the search function and output format.

For example, we can:

- search with date-restrict to only retrieve the latest information.
- search within a target-site to only create the answer from the contents from it.
- ask LLM to use a specific language to answer the question.
- ask LLM to answer with a specific length.
- crawl a specific list of urls and answer based on those contents only.

## Quick start

```bash
# recommend to use Python 3.10 or later and use venv or conda to create a virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# modify .env file to set the API keys or export them as environment variables as below

# right now we use Google search API
export SEARCH_API_KEY="your-google-search-api-key"
export SEARCH_PROJECT_KEY="your-google-cx-key"

# right now we use OpenAI API
export LLM_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# run the program
python ask.py -q "What is an LLM agent?"

# we can specify more parameters to control the behavior such as date_restrict and target_site
python ask.py --help
Usage: ask.py [OPTIONS]

  Search web for the query and summarize the results.

Options:
  -q, --query TEXT                Query to search
  -o, --output-mode [answer|extract]
                                  Output mode for the answer, default is a
                                  simple answer
  -d, --date-restrict INTEGER     Restrict search results to a specific date
                                  range, default is no restriction
  -s, --target-site TEXT          Restrict search results to a specific site,
                                  default is no restriction
  --output-language TEXT          Output language for the answer
  --output-length INTEGER         Output length for the answer
  --url-list-file TEXT            Instead of doing web search, scrape the
                                  target URL list and answer the query based
                                  on the content
  --extract-schema-file TEXT      Pydantic schema for the extract mode
  -m, --inference-model-name TEXT
                                  Model name to use for inference
  --hybrid-search                 Use hybrid search mode with both vector
                                  search and full-text search
  --web-ui                        Launch the web interface
  -l, --log-level [DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR]
                                  Set the logging level  [default: INFO]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```
