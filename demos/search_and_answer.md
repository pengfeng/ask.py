# Answer

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is necessary even with the existence of ChatGPT due to its multi-faceted capabilities that enhance the overall processing and retrieval of information. Specifically, Agentic RAG employs multiple agents that can manage retrieval tasks, document comparisons, and even perform specific operations like calculations, which are not inherently available in a single model like ChatGPT. This allows for a more streamlined and efficient process when addressing complex queries that require synthesis from various data points, ensuring that no critical context is lost during retrieval and generation processes[1][4]. Additionally, RAG's framework allows for greater flexibility and precision in handling varied types of queries, especially those that require comparative analysis or handling large volumes of data that exceed typical model limitations[2][5][6]. Furthermore, it enables the use of specialized agents that can focus on unique tasks, making the whole system more dynamic and capable of tackling intricate demands in real-time applications[4][6].

In short, while ChatGPT offers robust conversational capabilities, the agentic approach of RAG significantly broadens the scope and effectiveness of information processing for complex tasks.
