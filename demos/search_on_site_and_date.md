# Answer

OpenAI Swarm Framework is an experimental platform designed for building, orchestrating, and
deploying multi-agent systems, enabling multiple AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks. It contrasts
with traditional single-agent models by facilitating agent interaction and coordination, thus enhancing
efficiency[5][9]. The framework provides developers with a way to orchestrate these agent systems in
a lightweight manner, leveraging Node.js for scalable applications[1][4].

One implementation of this framework is Swarm.js, which serves as a Node.js SDK, allowing users to
create and manage agents that perform tasks and hand off conversations. Swarm.js is positioned as
an educational tool, making it accessible for both beginners and experts, although it may still contain
bugs and is currently lightweight[1][3][7]. This new approach emphasizes multi-agent collaboration and is
well-suited for back-end development, requiring some programming expertise for effective implementation[9].

Overall, OpenAI Swarm facilitates a shift in how AI systems can collaborate, differing from existing
OpenAI tools by focusing on backend orchestration rather than user-interactive front-end applications[9].
