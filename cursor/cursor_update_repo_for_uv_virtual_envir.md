I want to use uv as the virtual env manager. Please update the repo with necessary dependency and update the readme to show how to run the program with uv.

I'll help you update the repository to use `uv` as the virtual environment manager. Let me first check if there's a requirements.txt or similar file in the repository.

Let me check the current requirements.txt:

Now let me check if there's a README.md:

Let me check the current README.md:

I'll create a new `pyproject.toml` file for `uv` and update the README.md with instructions for using `uv`. First, let me create the `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "ask-py"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A Python program to implement the search-extract-summarize flow"
authors = [
    {name = "Peng Feng"}
]
dependencies = [
    "click==8.1.7",
    "requests==2.32.3",
    "numpy==1.26.4",
    "jinja2==3.1.3",
    "bs4==0.0.2",
    "python-dotenv==1.0.1",
    "openai==1.87.0",
    "duckdb==1.3.0",
    "gradio==5.34.0",
    "chonkie==1.0.10",
    "docling==2.36.0",
]
requires-python = ">=3.10"

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.rye]
managed = true
dev-dependencies = []
```

Now let me update the README.md with instructions for using `uv`:

```markdown
```bash
# recommend to use Python 3.10 or later and use venv or conda to create a virtual environment
% pip install -r requirements.txt

# modify .env file to set the API keys or export them as environment variables as below

->

```bash
# We recommend using uv as the virtual environment manager
# First install uv if you haven't:
% curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
% uv venv
% source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
% uv pip install -e .

# modify .env file to set the API keys or export them as environment variables as below
```

Now let me add a `.gitignore` file to ignore the virtual environment directory:

```ignore
# Virtual environment
.venv/
venv/

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/
.eggs/
lib/
lib64/
parts/
sdist/
var/
wheels/
*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg

# Environment variables
.env
.env.*

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo
```

I've made the following changes to update the repository to use `uv`:

1. Created a `pyproject.toml` file with all the project dependencies and metadata. This replaces the `requirements.txt` file and provides a more modern Python project structure.

2. Updated the README.md with instructions for using `uv`, including:
   - How to install `uv`
   - How to create a virtual environment with `uv`
   - How to install dependencies using `uv pip install -e .`

3. Added a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that includes:
   - Virtual environment directories
   - Python build artifacts and cache files
   - Environment variable files
   - IDE-specific files

The main advantages of using `uv` over traditional `pip` include:
- Much faster dependency resolution and installation
- Built-in virtual environment management
- Better reproducibility through lockfiles (though we haven't enabled this yet)
- Improved security through package verification

You can now delete the `requirements.txt` file since we've moved the dependencies to `pyproject.toml`:

The repository is now set up to use `uv` as the virtual environment manager. Users can follow the updated instructions in the README.md to set up their development environment and install dependencies using `uv`.

Would you like me to make any additional changes or clarify anything about the updates?

I notice from the error message that there's an issue with the package structure. The error indicates that Hatch (the build backend) can't find the package directory. Let me fix this by updating the `pyproject.toml` to specify the correct package structure.

```toml
[project]
name = "ask-py"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A Python program to implement the search-extract-summarize flow"
authors = [
    {name = "Peng Feng"}
]
dependencies = [
    "click==8.1.7",
    "requests==2.32.3",
    "numpy==1.26.4",
    "jinja2==3.1.3",
    "bs4==0.0.2",
    "python-dotenv==1.0.1",
    "openai==1.87.0",
    "duckdb==1.3.0",
    "gradio==5.34.0",
    "chonkie==1.0.10",
    "docling==2.36.0",
]
requires-python = ">=3.10"

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.rye]
managed = true
dev-dependencies = []

->

[project]
name = "ask-py"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A Python program to implement the search-extract-summarize flow"
authors = [
    {name = "Peng Feng"}
]
dependencies = [
    "click==8.1.7",
    "requests==2.32.3",
    "numpy==1.26.4",
    "jinja2==3.1.3",
    "bs4==0.0.2",
    "python-dotenv==1.0.1",
    "openai==1.87.0",
    "duckdb==1.3.0",
    "gradio==5.34.0",
    "chonkie==1.0.10",
    "docling==2.36.0",
]
requires-python = ">=3.10"

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["."]

[tool.rye]
managed = true
dev-dependencies = []
```

I've updated the `pyproject.toml` file to explicitly tell Hatch where to find the package files. Since `ask.py` is a single-file module in the root directory, I've set `packages = ["."]` to include the current directory.

Now let me also update the README.md to add a note about potential installation issues:

```markdown
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
% uv venv
% source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
% uv pip install -e .

# modify .env file to set the API keys or export them as environment variables as below

->

# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
% uv venv
% source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
% uv pip install -e .

# Alternatively, if you prefer not to install in editable mode, you can use:
% uv pip install .

# modify .env file to set the API keys or export them as environment variables as below
```

I've made two changes to fix the installation issues:

1. Added the `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` section to `pyproject.toml` to explicitly tell Hatch where to find the package files. This should resolve the "Unable to determine which files to ship" error.

2. Updated the README.md to provide an alternative installation method without editable mode, in case users encounter any issues with editable installation.

The installation should now work correctly with `uv`. Users can choose either:
- `uv pip install -e .` for editable installation (recommended during development)
- `uv pip install .` for regular installation

Would you like me to make any other changes or clarify anything about the updates?
